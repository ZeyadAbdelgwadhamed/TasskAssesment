Project Test Report
Introduction:
This test report provides an overview of the testing activities performed for the project developed using Java, Selenium, TestNG, and Data-Driven Testing. The project involves automated testing of a web application using various dependencies, including Web Browser Manager, Selenium, and TestNG. The testing was conducted on a Windows 10 64-bit operating system with Java version 17 and IntelliJ IDEA as the Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

Test Environment:
	Operating System: Windows 10 64-bit.
	Java Version: 17
	IDE: IntelliJ IDEA
	Dependencies:
	Web Browser Manager: A library for managing web browser instances.
	Selenium: A web testing framework for automating browser actions.
	TestNG: A testing framework for running automated tests and generating reports.
	Data-Driven Testing: A testing approach where test data is separated from test scripts.

Testing Process:
The testing process involved the following steps:
Step 1: Environment Setup:
Installed Java Development Kit (JDK) version 17 on the Windows 10 machine.
Configured the Java environment variables.
Installed IntelliJ IDEA IDE for Java development and testing.
Added the necessary dependencies (Web Browser Manager, Selenium, TestNG) to the project.

Step 2: Test Case Preparation:
Identified and documented test scenarios based on project requirements.
Developed test cases using TestNG annotations and data-driven testing concepts.
Prepared test data in external files or databases for data-driven testing.

Step 3: Test Execution:
Created test classes and methods using Java and TestNG.
Configured test suite XML file to group and execute test classes.
Implemented browser setup and teardown methods using Web Browser Manager and Selenium.
Executed the test suite using TestNG within IntelliJ IDEA.

Step 4: Test Result Analysis:
Observed the test execution progress and monitored any failures or errors.
Analyzed the test results and identified any defects or issues.
